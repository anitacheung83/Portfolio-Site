                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>Initially, I developed the League Statistic Bot with the intention to improve communication with
                    my
                    boyfriend. One of the challenges we face was the timing of my calls, particularly when my
                    boyfriend was
                    engrossed in a game of League of Legend. Understandably, interrupting him during those moments
                    would
                    lead to
                    frustration, and he humorously referred to himself as being "at war" in the game. Thus, I sought
                    a
                    solution
                    that would allow me to determine if he was currently playing League. By implementing the League
                    Statistic
                    Bot, I can now ascertain whether my boyfriend is playing League or not. Which enables me to wait
                    until
                    after
                    his game to reach out, ensuring our conversations are more enjoyable and uninterrupted.</p>
                <h3>Further Application</h3>
                <p>League Statistic Bot has become a helpful tool for my family, especially when it comes to my
                    younger
                    brother's gaming habits. He struggles with self-control and to manage his gaming time
                    effectively. So,
                    my
                    parents started using the bot to keep track of his playtime and help him with time management.
                    It's made
                    a
                    significant difference in his academic performance. With the bot's support, my parents can
                    better guide
                    him
                    and find a balance between gaming and his studies. It's been a positive intervention that's
                    created a
                    more
                    supportive environment for his growth and success.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>The League Statistic Bot is a Discord bot designed to fetch League of Legend game data using the Riot
                Games
                API. It utilizes Discord's slash commands feature to provide users with convenient ways to track
                summoner's
                games.</p>

            <p>Users can check if a summoner is currently playing League of Legends by using the /active slash command.
            </p>

            <div class="outer">
                <img src="images/league-bot-past.png" alt="past slash command" height="600">
            </div>

            <p>Moreover, users can request the data for the summoner's past 10 games by using /past slash command.</p>

            <div class="outer">
                <img src="images/league-bot-past.png" alt="past slash command" height="600">
            </div>

            <p>Additionally, the bot generates two graphs thorugh matplotlib. The first graph displays the total time
                played
                by the summoner
                during the last week, allowing users to visualize their gaming activity over time. The second graph
                shows
                the total number of games played by the summoner during last week, providing insights into their gaming
                frequency.</p>

            <div class="outer">
                <img src="images/total_time_played_graph.png" alt="graph" height="400">
                <img src="images/games_played_graph.png" alt="graph" height="400">
            </div>
            <p>Lastly, the bot generates a comprehensive weekly report that includes a list of games played by the
                summoner
                during the previous week and total time played graph and number of games played graph.</p>

            <h2>Hosting</h2>
            <p>
                Originally, the bot was hosted on Heroku, but recently they started charging $7 per month for command
                line
                access. Fortunately, I received a generous gift from my dad in the form of a Raspberry Pi. Now, the bot
                is
                hosted on my Raspberry Pi, allowing me to run it for free.
